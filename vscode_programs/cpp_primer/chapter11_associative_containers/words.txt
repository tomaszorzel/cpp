Premier League players have come under unfair criticism during the coronavirus pandemic, says England captain Harry Kane.
Last month health secretary Matt Hancock said players should take a pay cut and play their part.
We have shown we are doing everything we can to help support the NHS, charities and everyone who is struggling during this pandemic, Kane told BBC 5 Live.
We came under a bit of scrutiny and probably unfair criticism at times.
